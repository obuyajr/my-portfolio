Portfolio Website
This is a personal portfolio website built using PHP and MySQL. The website showcases my professional work and provides a way for potential clients or employers to contact me.

Getting Started
To use this website, you will need to have access to a web server running PHP and MySQL. You can install a local web server such as XAMPP or WAMP on your computer, or you can upload the website to a remote server.

Once you have a web server set up, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Setting Up the Database
Before you can use the website, you will need to set up the database. To do this, follow these steps:

Log in to your MySQL server and create a new database.
Import the SQL file located in the "database" directory of this repository into the new database.
Edit the "config.php" file in the "includes" directory to include your MySQL server credentials and the name of the database you just created.
Using the Website
Once the database is set up, you can access the website by opening the "index.php" file in your web browser. The website includes several pages:

Home: Displays an introduction to my work and skills.
Portfolio: Showcases my professional work and projects.
About: Provides more information about my background and experience.
Contact: A form for potential clients or employers to contact me.
The website also includes a simple CMS (content management system) that allows me to easily update the content of the website.

Built With
PHP - The programming language used for the website.
MySQL - The database management system used for storing the website data.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript - The front-end languages used for building the website layout and functionality.
